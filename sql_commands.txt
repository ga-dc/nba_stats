1. All columns for all players from the New York Knicks (NYK)
  SELECT * FROM players WHERE team = 'NYK';

2. All columns for all players from the Indiana Packers (IND) who are under 26 years old
  SELECT * FROM players WHERE team = 'IND' AND age < 26;

3. All columns for all players, ordered from least points scored to most points scored
  SELECT*FROM players ORDER BY points ASC;

4. Name and Points per game (points/games), for the players with the top 20 points per game
  SELECT name, (points/games) FROM players ORDER BY (points/games) DESC LIMIT 20;

5. The average age for all players
  SELECT avg(age) FROM players;

6. The average age for all players on the Oklahoma City Thunder (OKC)
  SELECT avg(age) FROM players WHERE team = 'OKC';

7. The average age for all players who played more than 40 games
  SELECT avg(age) FROM players WHERE games>40;

8. The team and total points scored from all players on that team (team points), ordered from most team points to least
  I'm not sure how to do this one.
